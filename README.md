# jest-es6-classes-fizzbuzz

Another fizzbuzz attempt. 

## Rules
A typical fizzbuzz with:

* Use es6 classes in the solution
* Use es6 syntax as much as possible
* ~~Data drive the tests~~ (not sure if possible with jest right now - will find out during kata)
* Data drive the game rules, for example with a json file for now


## Run tests with watch

package.json has "test": "jest --watch"

Tests will run when saving file, after change

```yarn test```

or

```npm run test```


## vscode plugins tried

JavaScript (ES6) code snippets ```xabikos.javascriptsnippets```

GitLens â€” Git supercharged ```eamodio.gitlens```

Git History ```donjayamanne.githistory```

Bracket Pair Colorizer ```coenraads.bracket-pair-colorizer```
